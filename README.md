# Inbred_NIR_Prediction
NIR of parents and hybrids to predict performance for publication

### pipeline of data analysis for inbred NIR data....
Step 1: calculated blues for each hybrids and inbreds at each environments
Step 2: Use blues to calculate mid-parent heterosis, high parent heterosis for each wavelengths (reflectance)
Step 3: fit into six models that are presented in proposal
