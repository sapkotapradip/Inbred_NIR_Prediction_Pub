# Inbred_NIR_Prediction
NIR of parents and hybrids to predict performance for publication

### pipeline of data analysis for inbred NIR data....
Step 1: calculated blues for each hybrids and inbreds at each environments
Step 2: Use blues to calculate mid-parent heterosis, high parent heterosis for each wavelengths (reflectance)
Step 3: fit into six models that are presented in proposal
Step 4: use lasso, deep learning, or AI models at first; try machine learning models such as svm, random forest, elastic net and lasso
Step 5: Fit multi- trait phenomic model using DA and PH from parents to compare predictability


# Daniel and Noah inputs 

GCA from CS and other locations 
prediction of new cv schemes leave certain % inbred !
GCA from
leave one parent, both parents left out !
line x tester: one evaluated one left out !
